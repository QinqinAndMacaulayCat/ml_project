# Proposal: Predicting Corporate Bond Credit Spreads Using Machine Learning

## 1. Objective

The objective of this project is to **predict corporate bond credit spreads** using firm-level fundamentals, market-based risk factors, and macroeconomic indicators.  
By applying various machine learning regression models — **Lasso**, **Ridge**, **ElasticNet**, **Decision Tree**, and **XGBoost** — we aim to identify the key drivers of credit spreads and evaluate how well these models capture the cross-sectional variation in credit risk across firms.

This project combines traditional credit risk modeling with modern ML methods and uses real bond and issuer data available from **WRDS**.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Description

We will obtain and merge the following datasets from WRDS:

| Source | Dataset | Key Variables | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------|
| **TRACE (FINRA)** | Bond trade data | Bond ID (CUSIP), trade price, yield, maturity, coupon | Used to compute market-based bond yields and spreads |
| **Mergent FISD** | Bond characteristics | Issue date, rating, callable/convertible flag, issue size | Bond-level descriptors |
| **Compustat** | Firm fundamentals | Leverage, profitability, total assets, interest coverage | Issuer financial strength |
| **CRSP** | Stock data | Stock return volatility, beta, recent returns | Market-based firm risk |
| **FRED** | Macroeconomic variables | Treasury yield curve, VIX, CPI, GDP growth | Systemic and macro risk indicators |

The **target variable** is the bond's **credit spread**, defined as:
$$
\text{Spread}_i = \text{Bond Yield}_i - \text{Treasury Yield (same maturity)}
$$
or, if available, the **Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS)** from FISD.

### 2.2 Feature Construction

- **Bond-specific features**: maturity, coupon rate, callable/convertible flag, issue size.
- **Issuer-level features**: leverage ratio, coverage ratio, ROA, total assets.
- **Market-based features**: stock return volatility, beta, recent performance.
- **Macroeconomic variables**: Treasury yields (1Y–10Y), term spread, VIX, inflation rate.

All predictors will be standardized and merged using the bond issuer CUSIP or GVKEY link.

### 2.3 Modeling Framework

We will compare five regression models:

| Model | Description | Key Property |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Ridge Regression** | Penalizes large coefficients with L2 norm | Handles multicollinearity |
| **Lasso Regression** | L1 penalty for feature selection | Identifies key predictors |
| **ElasticNet** | Combination of L1 and L2 | Balance between Ridge and Lasso |
| **Decision Tree** | Non-linear split-based model | Captures interactions |
| **XGBoost** | Gradient-boosted decision trees | High predictive power, feature importance |

Evaluation metrics:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R² (Out-of-sample)
- Feature importance analysis

Cross-validation will be used for hyperparameter tuning.

## 3. Implementation Plan

| Stage | Task | Tools / Libraries |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| **Data Collection** | Download TRACE, FISD, Compustat, CRSP, FRED data | WRDS web query, Python (wrds API) |
| **Data Cleaning & Merging** | Join bond- and issuer-level data via CUSIP/GVKEY | `pandas`, `numpy` |
| **Feature Engineering** | Compute spreads, standardize features | `pandas`, `scikit-learn` |
| **Modeling** | Train Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Tree, XGBoost | `sklearn`, `xgboost` |
| **Validation & Analysis** | Out-of-sample testing, feature importance | `matplotlib`, `seaborn` |
| **Write-up** | Summarize findings, compare models | Markdown / PDF report |

## 4. Expected Results

- **Performance**: Tree-based models (especially XGBoost) are expected to outperform linear models in predictive accuracy due to non-linear relationships among firm and market variables.
- **Interpretability**: Lasso and ElasticNet will help identify the most influential features (e.g., leverage, volatility, credit rating).
- **Financial insight**: 
  - Quantify how macro and firm-level factors drive credit spreads.
  - Demonstrate that incorporating non-linear and interaction effects improves spread modeling.
- **Practical relevance**: Results can guide portfolio managers and risk analysts in credit risk assessment, pricing, and bond portfolio construction.

## 5. Significance

Predicting credit spreads is crucial for bond pricing, risk management, and valuation.  
This project bridges the gap between traditional financial econometrics and modern machine learning by applying interpretable, data-driven models to real-world fixed income data from WRDS.

The approach not only enhances predictive accuracy but also provides insight into **how firm fundamentals, market volatility, and macro conditions jointly determine credit risk** — a key concern in both academia and industry.
